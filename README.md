D3 Bootcamp Data Analytics Challenge

Using D3 is amazing, how to make the data look in a visual way that is impressive. If it is something more complicated I would say another world and also implements d3-tip another small world that also brings interesting things.
I finished the main part but very satisfied with how D3 works.

A very interesting challenge of how to represent information regardless of the topic.
